#Assisted Installer Kube API CR examples

[docs/crds](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service/tree/master/docs/crds) stores working examples of various resources we spawn via kube-api in assisted-installer, for Hive integration.
Those examples are here for reference.

You will likely need to adapt those for your own needs.

* [InstalllEnv](crds/installEnv.yaml)
* [NMState Config](crds/nmstate.yaml)
* [Hive PullSecret Secret](crds/pullsecret.yaml)
* [Hive ClusterDeployment](crds/clusterDeployment.yaml)
* [Hive ClusterDeployment-SNO](crds/clusterDeployment-SNO.yaml)
